     rosserial_xbee provides tools to do point to multipoint communication
     between rosserial nodes connected to an xbee.  All of the nodes
     communicate back to a master xbee connected to a computer running
     ROS.  This software currently only works with Series 1 Xbees.
     
     This pkg includes python code from the python-xbee project:
